# thermostat
Python smart thermostat based on a Raspberry Pi and an Adafruit touchscreen.

When launching menu.py for a second or subsequent time you need to ctrl-c when prompted.  EDIT:  Fixed.
Thanks to this thread:  https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=22306

I found that setting the framebuffer_width and height in /boot/config.txt correctly fixed the issue.
